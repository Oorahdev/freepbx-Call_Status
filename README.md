FeePBX Call Status
===================

Forked from http://sysadminman.net/blog/2013/asterisk-outbound-call-status-page-5600 and modified for FreePBX system running version 2.9 or higher.
This is a simple HTML page that displays all active calls on a FreePBX system. This is not a FreePBX module, and does not require system credentials to view.

## Requirements
FreePBX version 2.9 or later. 

## Installation
* On a FreePBX system, download the files to the folder `[webroot]/call-status`
* chown and chmod folder and files as necessary
* In a browser, navigate to `http://<ipaddress>/call-status`.
